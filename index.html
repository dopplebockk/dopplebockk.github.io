		<p>The Higgerson School State Historic Site, located on Main Street in New Madrid, Missouri, pays homage to the new and old. Believed to be the last one-room school house to close in the state, this building was moved in 1998 from its original location eleven miles east of 		town to where it resides now. The site also hosts a gift shop and museum dedicated to preserving the Higgerson family legacy. We would be honored to have you as our guest and visitor. Whereas our website is still under construction while we are closed for the season 				<strong>through March 24th, 2019</strong>, please feel free to take a look around our available pages and check back often!</p>
